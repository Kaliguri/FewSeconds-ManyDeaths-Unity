      Varadora''s Aegis is his final, best work. The last blow of the hammer proved
      fatal for him. He spent all his potential, all the power of his body and soul
      to create this artifact.


      The work turned out to be so good that the
      armor gained life. They knew what they were created for. They were created
      to protect.


      Using the rune magic written on it, as well as his understanding
      of the aspect of Protection, the Aegis of Varadora is able to spread a protective
      aura to his allies to protect them from even the most powerful blow.'
