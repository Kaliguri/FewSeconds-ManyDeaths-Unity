    m_Localized: 'The grandmaster is a young man who came from afar. At his age,
      he was already able to learn the concept of Tactics, and interpret it with
      his ability to play chess, having the opportunity to control the surrounding
      space.


      His skills allow him to effectively support his team by moving
      them during dangerous situations. Or he can change the location of opponents
      so that they miss or lose the advantage of their position.


      However,
      the skills themselves do not have any effect on the character. They can''t
      hurt, they can''t heal, or they can''t protect. Because of this, this character
      may be difficult to understand.'

    m_Localized: Chess is the language spoken by the soul. And each part is a song
      that resonates in the hearts of those who play!
