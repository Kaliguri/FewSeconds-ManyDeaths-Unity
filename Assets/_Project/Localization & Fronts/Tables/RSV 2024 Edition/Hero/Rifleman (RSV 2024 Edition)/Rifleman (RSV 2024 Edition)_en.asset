    m_Localized: "Since childhood, Darkness has been drawn to Erdan. The creatures
      of the night felt him, and he felt Them. He was afraid of Them. And this fear
      became the source of nightmares.\n\nBut one day he found a divine weapon..
      Each shot carried a light. But with each shot, he saw more frightening nightmares.
      \n\nWhen he was alone, his hands began to tremble violently. He hated being
      alone. This prompted him to create a Guild.\n\nHe has learned the Aspect of
      Light. And the horror of Darkness. His shots are accurate, and especially dangerous
      if there is an ally nearby. His speeches can be inspiring. His title is a Weapon
      of Light."
