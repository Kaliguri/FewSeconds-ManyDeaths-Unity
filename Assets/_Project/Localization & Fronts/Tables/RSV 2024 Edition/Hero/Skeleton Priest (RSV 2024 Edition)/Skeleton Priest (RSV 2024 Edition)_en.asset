    m_Localized: "He doesn't have a name. He doesn't have a title. Everyone refers
      to him by his attire and appearance. Just a \"Skeleton Priest.\" \n\nSomeone
      can safely say that he saw how, before his career as a mercenary, he worked
      as an ordinary cook, feeding all the stray cats in the city. Indeed, this story
      seems excessively strange and far-fetched. Although, usually, these are the
      most truthful stories.\n\nWith a good understanding of the Concept of Life,
      he is able to heal his allies even from mortal wounds. But it seems as if his
      main strength is connected with a completely different concept..."
