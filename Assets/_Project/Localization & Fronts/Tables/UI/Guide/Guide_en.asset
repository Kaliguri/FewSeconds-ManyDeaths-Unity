      that change the gameplay upside down:\r\n\r\n1. Allies!\r\nThe game is built
      around interactions with other players. All gameplay is currently balanced
      around the fact that a team of 4 players of different roles have to face the
      Boss together.\r\n2. limited time!\r\nThere is very, very little time to make
      decisions. These conditions make it necessary to communicate quickly and find
      solutions."

      of powerful opponents. \r\nThe battle itself has a couple of non-standard rules
      for tactical combat. \r\n\r\n1. First run - then hit!\r\nYour move is divided
      into two stages. \u2018Moving\u2019 and \u2019Using abilities.\u2019 As soon
      as you use any ability, you lose the ability to move your hero.\r\nHowever,
      you can cancel the use of an ability to return to the \u2018Moving\u2019 stage.\r\nWhen
      player moves are played, each player's \u2018Move\u2019 stage is played first,
      then the \u2018Use Abilities\u2019 stage.\r\n\r\n2. Change initiative every
      turn!\r\nAll players move first, then the Boss.\r\nHowever, the order of the
      players' moves changes each round of moves.\r\nThe actual order of moves is
      displayed at the bottom left.\r\n\r\n3. Heal enemies, destroy allies!\r\nAbility
      effects have no limit on the purpose of use. If you make a mistake, you may
      well damage allies or aid your opponent! "
