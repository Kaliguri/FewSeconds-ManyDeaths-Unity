    m_Localized: 'Night. You are heading along a way located next to the forest.
      You are very tired, but you have not yet found a good place to rest.


      Your
      eyes are already closing. You''re blinking. Suddenly you see an unusual coin
      flying right in front of you. It reflects the moonlight and.. Is that <b><color=red>blood</color></b>?


      An
      otherworldly voice asks, "Heads? Or Tails? What are you betting on?"


      Time
      seemed to stand still, waiting for your decision.'
